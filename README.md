# international-search-and-rescue-animal-App
This app/system is to track dogs and monkeys as search and rescue animals. 
The system is designed to record important data such as name, breed, gender, age, weight, training status, and country of service for dogs. 
For monkeys, the system also records tail length, height, body length, and species.

This includes the creation of a Monkey Class that inherits from the RescueAnimal class and includes monkey-specific attributes 
with mutator and accessor methods. The Driver Class is also completed with a menu loop that displays a menu, prompts the user 
for input, validates the input, and takes appropriate actions based on the input.

The system allows for the intake of new dogs and monkeys, with prompts for user input and data validation. 
It also allows for the reservation of animals, with a check to ensure that the animal matches input criteria 
before updating the ‘reserved’ attribute of the animal. 
The system also includes a method to print information about the animals, 
with options to print a list of all dogs or monkeys, or all animals that are in service and available (not ‘reserved’).
